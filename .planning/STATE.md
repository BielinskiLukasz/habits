# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-26)

**Core value:** Daily check-in must be friction-free, and the system's existing model (waves, stages, multi-occurrence, threshold-based graduation) must be honored exactly as the user already practices it.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — PWA Shell & Tooling Hygiene

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (PWA Shell & Tooling Hygiene)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-26 — Roadmap created; 123 v1 requirements mapped across 6 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Locked at roadmap creation:

- Stack: vanilla multi-file HTML/JS/CSS, two HTML shells, raw IndexedDB, no framework/bundler/npm
- 7 IDB stores: habits, habit_versions, logs, events, settings, meta, score_snapshots
- Architecture spine: date → idb → schema → repo → seed → store/apply → sync → lifecycle → SW → router → today view
- Scoring: S1/S2/S3 all three implemented with Settings toggle; S1 default
- CSV delimiter: `;` (semicolon), UTF-8 BOM, CRLF
- Undo persists across reload via `meta.undoToken`
- Mobile↔desktop: explicit Settings link, no auto-redirect
- Definition edits NEVER rewrite history (versioned via `habit_versions`)
- Distinct mobile + desktop DOMs (not responsive)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet. Note for Phase 6: scoring formulas in FEATURES.md are sketches; precise spec (denominator handling, S2 stage-weight curve, S3 load-curve calibration) needs deeper work during Phase 6 planning.
